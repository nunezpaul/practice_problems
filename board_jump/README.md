You’re given a board game which is a row of squares, each  labeled with an integer. This can be represented by a list,
e.g. [1, 3, 2, 0, 5, 2, 8, 4, 1] Given a start position on the board, you “win” by landing on a zero, where you move by
jumping from square to square either left or right the number of spaces specified on the square you’re currently on.
Your task is to implement the function: def can_win(board, pos): returns True if you can win the board from that
starting pos, False otherwise
